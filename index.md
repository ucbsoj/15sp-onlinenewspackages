##Course Description

In this course, students will design and build online news packages for desktop and mobile web from the ground up. The course will be a mix of concept and practical application of digital news design. Students will learn to develop prototypes, iterate design concepts and code the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to implement their vision.

We cover an enormous amount of material during each class session, and every session builds off previous sessions. For this reason, attendance during every class is required (university-approved exceptions will be allowed.) Students who believe they are likely to miss sessions should seek approval to audit instead.

*This syllabus is fluid and will change. You are responsible for checking for updates regularly.*

###News Package Critique
In pairs — with dates and groups assigned by lottery — do an analysis of an existing news package or product that you find innovative in some way. The “innovation” could be design, technical, editorial or social in nature. 

This assignment consists of two parts:

1. A 10 minute presentation of the package. 
2. An 800 to 1,000 word report of your findings, which is due the Saturday before you present by 8pm. This report should be the basis of your presentation.

To successfully complete this assignment, you must:

* Interview at least one journalist directly involved via phone, video or in person. We use the term “journalist” in a broad, modern sense: editor, reporter, designer, developer, social media producer, photographer, videographer, etc.
* Succinctly communicate why the project is innovative.
* Discuss how the story or product exists on various social, mobile and desktop platforms.
* Be able to discuss any tools or techniques that helped make the project possible. 
* Highlight any missed opportunities. For example, a project might work well on desktop but fail on mobile. 
* Help the class understand how they might apply these lessons to our projects.
