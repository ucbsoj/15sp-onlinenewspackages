assignment: "Two things: 1. In your groups, prepare story pitches for your combined final project for both this and your Advanced Visual Journalism course. You'll pitch your story ideas to all four professors and your colleagues in class. In additional to editorial ideas, come prepared to discuss possible story forms for your ideas, keeping in mind what we discussed in class this week. We'll be looking for ideas that take advantage of possibility beyond just the basics of a single media type. Have your pitches rehearsed and professional. 2. In your News Package Critique group, submit to bCourse two project ideas, including a brief summary of why you'd like to report on them."
