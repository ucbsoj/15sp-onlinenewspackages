Don't worry about recreating a site brand, navgiation or other elements, including photos. Focus just on the story copy. Make sure you use at least the following elements: html, head, title, body, h1, h2, p. Style anyway you see fit, but make sure you follow all of ProPublica's rules for <a href='http://www.propublica.org/about/steal-our-stories'>using their content</a>.
