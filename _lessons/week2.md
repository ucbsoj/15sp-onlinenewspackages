assignment: Based on feedback from the story pitches, each should prepare a detailed storyboard/wireframe of the selected story for presentation to the class. The storyboard should include a "low resolution" mock of the story, making sure to block out major sections of the presentation and denoting types of planned media. Post the storyboard online and submit a <a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1306168/discussion_topics/3839868">link to it in bCourse</a>. While you show it to the class next week, be prepared to discuss any interactive elements, feeling free to show real-world examples that illustrate your ideas. Your storyboard is meant to help you start identifying the tasks ahead -- editorial, design and technical -- so you can start planning an approach to accomplish your vision. The storyboard is not a contract; you'll have opportunity to change course as your story elements start to come together and you have a better understanding of the production required to build the various pieces.
