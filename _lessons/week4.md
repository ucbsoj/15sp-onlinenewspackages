description: "We will start with critique assignment. This class will pick up where the Web Skills class left off. It will first cover an overview of HTML5: tags, nesting, and attributes. Then it will go into some basic CSS review: id and class selectors, various properties, and using Google Fonts. During this class, we will take some time to get everyone's computer setup with the proper software and development environment."
